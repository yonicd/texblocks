# texblocks

Building blocks for TeX tables

## Idea

Assemble LaTeX tabular environments using simple operations.

This would enable us to create any table layout with a consistent user API.

Defining a new class of R element `tabular` that is the basic structure of the language.

For Syntax: see [pdf](https://ghe.metrumrg.com/yoni/texblocks/blob/master/Syntax.pdf).

  - Joining elements
    - appending columnwise
    - appending rowwise
  
  - Mutations
    - multirow
    - multicolumn
  
  - Aesthetics
    - font: colour, size, face
    - background colour
